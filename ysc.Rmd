# Australian Cancer Atlas

???
(Title slide)
Good morning, my name is Stephanie.
I want to start by saying thank you to the organisers for this opportunity to speak to you today.
I am a Research Masters student at QUT, working with Prof. Kerrie Mengersen and Dr. Earl Duncan. This work is also co-supervised by Prof. Dianne Cook at Monash University.

(Atlas slide)
I have been focused on visual statistics, specifically how our use of maps or alternative visualisations allows us to see spatial distributions.

This work was inspired by the Australian Cancer Atlas.
This is an online, interactive web tool for exploring the impact of cancer on Australia, through the visualisation of Incidence Rates and Excess Death Rates.

# States and Territories

???
These coloured regions are the states and territories of Australia.
They are coloured accoring to the amount of geographic land they occupy.
The darkest colour on this map is the area in sqkms of Western Australia.

To paraphrase Kahneman:
We treate the limited information we have as if it were all there is to know.
We build the best possible stories from the information available to us and if it is a good story, we believe it."

We give our attention to what is observable, 
here the largest state with the darkest colour draws our attention.

# Australian Capital Territory

???
The Australian Capital Territory is extremely important in Australia.
For one, Canberra is the capital city, and the location of the conference.
More importantly it is where our Representative and Senators come to govern our country.

# Where are the people?

???
This map may be appropriate in some cases, but for our work, we are interested in the spatial distribution of cancer, and cancer affects people.

These are statistical areas, at level 4. These are part of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard created and used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
In regional areas, SA4s tend to have populations closer to the minimum (100,000 - 300,000)
In metropolitan areas, the SA4s tend to have larger populations (300,000 - 500,000).

SA3s are more flexible, they have between 30,000 and 130,000 persons.

???
SA2s generally have 3,000 to 25,000 people. These are functional communities, like rural town centres, or metropolitan suburbs.
We can use this idea of small communities to drive research into the spatial distribution of cancers across Australians, by comparing and smoothing across communities.

# A different perspective

???
When the goal is to see the population, there are several visualisation methods that have been developed.
This display shows a contiguous cartogram, noncontiguous cartogram, dorling cartogram and a hexagon tile map.
